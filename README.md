# EKF-SLAM using corner features

This project presents solving SLAM problem using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) paired with natural features of the map i.e. corners.
The corner landmarks allow simultaneous robot localization and building of a corner-based map of the environment. For experiments, a turtle-bot mounted with a 3D LIDAR is used.
The algorithm is designed and implemented in ROS.
